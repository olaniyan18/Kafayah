							<h2>Meet Me</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Hello, Welcome! I'm Kafayah, a committed and enthusiastic data scientist with experience using data to drive insightful decision-making and extract useful insights. My experience working in the field of data science has given me a wide range of talents, such as a command of machine learning techniques, familiarity with programming languageÂ like Python, and a talent for data visualization.

							I'm excited to keep up with the most recent advancements in the area, keep learning new skills, and give back to the data science community as a lifelong student. I am enthusiastic about the prospects that lay ahead in this dynamic and quickly developing industry since I firmly believe that data has the ability to alter industries.

								<h3>Predicting Diabetes and Heart Disease</h3>
								<p>The DecisionTree model had an accuracy of about 79% on the test set, which was decent for its performance in identifying whether or not a patient had diabetes. 
									This implies that the software can find trends in the data to precisely estimate the likelihood that a patient would acquire diabetes in addition to The accuracy of the model used to diagnose heart disease in patients was 80%.

								<h3>Automobiles price in Nigeria</h3>
								<p>Created a model that uses variables such car year, brand, and so on to predict the price of various cars. The model achieved a performance score of over 80%.

								<h3>Loan Financial Prediction</h3>
								<p>An instance of loan default occurs when a borrower takes money out of a bank without paying back the loan. 
									People default on loans all the time for a variety of reasons. 
									Defaulting debtors face not only the damage to their credit but also the risk of being sued and having their wages seized.
									With satisfactory performance, the k-NN model's test set's roc auc score on the loan default task was 95%. 
									This shows how the model may use data patterns to forecast a loan risk default with roc auc.

								<h3>Classifying Crop Pests</h3>
								<p>This research's main goal was to develop a pest detection system that could identify any pest images unique to five crops and provide a chemical treatment.
